Calculating Your Pregnancy Estimated Due Date (EDD)
========================================================

- This is a simple app to calculate the due date for a pregnancy using the standard rule which is Naegele's rule. 

- The Naegele's rule estimates the expected date of delivery (EDD) by adding one year, subtracting three months, and adding seven days to the first day of a woman's last menstrual period (LMP).

- The result is approximately 280 days (40 weeks) from the start of the last menstrual period.

Reference : <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naegele%27s_rule>

Using The Application
========================================================

To use the application, the user must:

- Enter her name.
- Enter the date of the first day of her last menstrual period (LMP).

The application will calculate the estimated due date upon clicking the 'Calculate' button.
